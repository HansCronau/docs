Simple Analytics never collects any personal identifiable information. Ad-blockers see us as just any other analytics company and some of the ad-blockers are blocking our domain as a result. To prevent your stats being blocked as a result we allow you to setup a bypass. This basically hides Simple Analytics' server name from the browser by redirecting a subdomain to our domain.

## Setup a custom subdomain

You only need access to your DNS to set this up. Add a CNAME record to your DNS pointing to `external.simpleanalytics.com.` _(including the last dot `.`)_ and fill in your own full domain here. We advise to choose a domain like `api.example.com` instead of `track.example.com` _(tracking, analytics, collect, and similar keywords are usually blocked)_.

You will need to enable the record in [your website settings](https://simpleanalytics.com/select-website/settings#bypass-ad-blockers) on Simple Analytics. We need to know this to request a certificate with <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a>. This means your analytics will travel safe via HTTPS to our servers.
